# LSM in a Week

My implementation for [Chi's tutorial](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm) of building an LSM-Tree storage engine in a week.

## My Progress 

- [x] Day1: Implement memtables based on skiplists and freezing memtable logic.
- [x] Day2: Implement memtable iterator and merge iterator based on binary heap.
- [x] Day3: Implement SST (Sorted String Table) block encoding, decoding and block iterator.
- [x] Day4: Implement SST encoding, decoding and SST iterator with binary search algorithm.
- [x] Day5: Implement LSM read path.
